How to run:
1. Clone from GitHub using the command: `git clone https://github.com/amalvinzent/flavors_react.git`.
2. Open the project, then enter `npm i` in the terminal.
3. Then enter `npm run dev`.

Notes:
1. I didn't use semantic HTML because there is lesser support for semantic tags in HTML4-supported browsers.
2. I have mostly used CSS2 properties to support older browsers.

Things that can be added:
1. Vendor prefixes can be added in CSS to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
2. Options in the suggestor component can come from the backend as a list.
3. Zustand can be used to manage state when there are multiple components and data needs to be passed around.
